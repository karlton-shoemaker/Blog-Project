## A Place to List All Your Thoughts
For my MVC mastery project at We Can Code IT, I created a site in which users could post all of their opinions about anything, no matter how trivial the topic. There are three starter topics of Food, Movies, and Video Games, but anyone can add their own topic of their choice. In addition to different topics, you can post opinions about each topic and then comment on those opinions.

N.B. If you clone this and run in Visual Studio, you will have to run update-database in the Package Manager Console in order for it to work properly.
